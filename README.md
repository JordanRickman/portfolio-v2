Portfolio-v2
============

This is my online portfolio / personal webpage.
It is both a way to present myself, and to hone my responsive CSS3 skills.
When completed, it will be live at [http://jordan-rickman.net](http://jordan-rickman.net).

It is "v2" because it replaces the project at [https://github.com/JordanRickman/online-portfolio](https://github.com/JordanRickman/online-portfolio),
which was a neat concept but ultimately not very user-friendly.
